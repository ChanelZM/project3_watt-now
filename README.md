## Introduction
Watt-Now is a company that organizes more green and environmentally friendly festivals and gives advice about how to spend less money on power. Watt-Now came to us for advice on making the festivals even more money saving. They wanted real time information about the current state of the generators and power consumption at the events.

## Concept
Our target group is the on-site tech crew and Watt-Now. On-site tech crew can anticipate on the data that's received and decrease power consumption where possible. Watt-Now can analyze the data to discover how to be even more power saving in next cases.

### Input Data
-

### Output Data
-

### Events

### Reaction
If the amount of visiters at a certain stage decreases, the technicians can decide
- to turn the boxes off at the far end of the stage.
- to turn the volume down a little bit.
- to change the lighting settings into something less heavy.

If the data is sent to Watt-Now, employees can
- analyze the data to save even more power on the next event.
- use the data to show to potential clients.
- real time information about the current situation at the event.
- potentially jump in when problems may occur.
